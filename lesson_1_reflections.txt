How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug
that was introduced?

    Diff made it very easy to see where changes were made. This means we did not
    waste time comparing hundreds of lines that were exactly the same between
    the files

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Can easily compare code between older files, add back old features, or find
    where a recent bug may be located.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create
a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved,
like Google Docs does?

    Pros: you can make commits at logical points
    Cons: You may forget to make a commit, or lose changes before having
    an opportunity to commit

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving
multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs,
treat each file separately?

    Git is a more powerful system


How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Git log will show all the commits
    Git Diff will show all the changes between the selected commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You still have all the code saved before the changes in the previous commit

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
    To have better control and confidence when building projects
