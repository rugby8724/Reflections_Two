When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  When working from multiple computers or with multiple people

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Multiple people maybe working on the same file and not want someone's
    changes pulled automatically
